Currently this logger works, however it is only compilable with a C++11 compiler.

In order to make it compatible for FIRST, the remaining objectives are:

    1. Write a reference counting smart pointer to replaced std::shared_ptr
    2. Remove the C++11 features added (Such as strongly typed enums).
    3. Design a utility similar to make_shared. There are potential problems here without
        variadic templates, type safety may be impossible.
    4. Add multiple examples for use.
